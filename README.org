*** CMake Examples

    This repository includes some examples CMake configurations I have made when learning CMake.

    All examples written in C are inspired by [[https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples][cmake-examples]], which includes examples written in CPP.

    It's the best tutorial I ever seen on the internet (in my own opinion).

    As a C programming beginner who has very limited knowledge of CPP programming,

    I create this repository for the purpose of exploring the usages of CMake in C programming.
